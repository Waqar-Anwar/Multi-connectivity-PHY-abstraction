This document explain the procedure for multi-connectivity performance evalution with link combining schemes

To plot AWGN curves for different MCSs, please use script "input_parameter_setting.m" with "Sim_Para.AWGN = true". Please don't forget to select the modulation, coding rate and packet size parameters
To simulate multi-connectivity performance same script "input_parameter_setting.m" need to be run with "Sim_Para.AWGN = false". Please don't forget to select the number of links and link combining scheme.

In order to evalute performance using PHY abstraction, plese run "run_multiconnectivity_phy_asbstraction.m" with relavent parameters

AWGN look-up tables are available in "AWGN_look_up_300_bytes.mat".

Channel relalizations are provided at "https://www.dropbox.com/s/gldz6fbchu5ppk2/channel_k0_2k_fr64_L4.mat?dl=0". These samples represent 10000 channels, 4 multi-connectivity links, 38 numbers of symbols and 64 number of the subcarriers: [64x38x4x10000].
