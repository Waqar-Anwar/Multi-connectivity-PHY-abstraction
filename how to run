This document explain the procedure for multi-connectivity performance evalution with link combining schemes

To plot AWGN curves for different MCSs, please use script "input_parameter_setting.m" with "Sim_Para.AWGN = true". Please don't forget to select the modulation, coding rate and packet size parameters
To simulate multi-connectivity performance same script "input_parameter_setting.m" need to be run with "Sim_Para.AWGN = false". Please don't forget to select the number of links and link combining scheme.
